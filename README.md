# unity-panel-manager-interfaces
A PanelManager manages a set of panels that can be opened and closed. A common example would be a manager for a set of popup windows (each window being a kind of Panel). The interfaces for PanelManager are kept in a separate package to allow other packages to interact with PanelManagers without depending on any implementation.
